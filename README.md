# Oranges
Pygame_Battleship_19.py is currently are launchable. It requires 3 things for it to work. You have to have pygame intalled, you have to have random installed(pretty sure this comes with python), and at the bottom there is a start_btn.png, you will have to import it into VS code and copy the path. Change the file path to the button on line 18(theres a arrow pointing to it).
