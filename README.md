This is the final Battle Ship project for the 2023 Robins Airforce Base Internship. 

Pygame_Battleship_26.py is currently launchable. It requires 4 things for it to work. You have to have pygame intalled, you have to have random installed(pretty sure this comes with python), at the bottom pf the repository there is a start_btn.png and a rotate.png, you will have to download and import both into VS code and copy there final path. Change the file path to the button on line 19(theres a arrow pointing to it) and change the file path to the rotate on line 20(theres a arrow pointing to it)




Place your ships prior to the start of the game. To rotate ships drag them in the box located in the bottom left corner of the game screen.
Press the start key and begin your game of battle ship against the computer.
